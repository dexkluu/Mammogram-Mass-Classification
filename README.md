# Mammogram-Mass-Classification
This project focuses on finding the best model to classify masses using mammogram mass data from the UCI repository. Being able to accurately identify benign and malignant masses using machine learning methods can serve as another set of eyes before giving out a diagnostic. Proceeding in the wrong direction due to a misdiagnosis can be life threatening.

## Tools Used

The analysis was done using Python version 3.6.5 on a Jupyter Notebook. The libraries used were pandas, numpy, sklearn, and matplotlib.

## The Process

The data contained some missing values and some of the classification models benefit from scaling the data so some prep work was done before beginning the analysis. After cleaning and prepping the data, it was split into testing and training sets and various models were trained and tested on it. The results were compared and the best performing model was noted.

## Replicate the analysis

To replicate my results, one could simply run the code in the Jupyter Notebook. The data is included in the repository but it can also be found from the UCI repository where it was originally found.
